              A diffuse axonal injury is a type of traumatic brain injury (TBI)
              causes widespread damage to nerve fibres throughout the brain,
              resulting in bleeding, bruising of brain tissue, and tearing of
              nerve fibres.

              The force of the injury may cause shearing of the axons â€“ these
              are also known as nerve fibres, and refer to a portion of the
              nerve cell designed to carry nerve impulses away from the main
              cell body. Essentially, they are responsible for carrying
              electricalimpulses between nerve cells.

                DAI is typically diagnosed using imaging scans, such as an MRI
                or CT scan. These scans will be able to detect the shearing of
                nerve fibres in the brain, as well as any bleeding or swelling
                that may have occurred.

                In addition, a neurological assessment and neuropsychological
                assessment may be conducted to determine the extent of cognitive
                impairment. This can involve cognitive tests, as well as an
                assessment of physical injuries and behavioural and emotional
                changes.

                Treatment for DAI typically involves supportive care and

                swelling, manage pain, and control seizures.Experts may also
                recommend physical therapy to help to improve coordination and
