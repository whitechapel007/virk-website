              The aftermath of a car accident can be overwhelming as you have
              entered unfamiliar territory and no doubt have a lot of unanswered
              questions. Whether you suffered a spinal cord injury, brain injury
              or fractures, you need to know your rights immediately â€“ before
              you discuss the matter with an insurance adjuster and before
              signing any documents.

              Insurance companies scrutinize and defend claims vigorously and
              are looking out for their own interests, not yours. There are many
              strict time frames (some as short as 7 days after a car accident)
              as well as many procedures which need to be followed. Insurance
              companies complicate the process further by demanding in-person
              meetings and requiring complex forms to be completed within a very
              short timeframe. Understanding how to navigate through all of
              these issues, while trying to recover from an injury or mourning
              the loss of a loved one, is often too much to handle without help.
